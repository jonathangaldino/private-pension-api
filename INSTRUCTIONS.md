# Instructions

## Introduction

Consider the following hypothetical private pension plan rescue.
Your challenge is to build a REST API, which makes it possible to perform the following actions:
• Customer registration
• Product registration
• Plan contracting
• Plan redemption
• Extra contribution

## Rules

• For the customer to contract a plan, it must be within the sales period and above the minimum contribution of the product.
• To carry out the redemption, the customer must comply with the redemption rules defined in the product.
• A plan without a balance will be automatically canceled and no further operations can be carried out on it.
• To make an extra contribution, the customer must comply with the rules defined in the product.

## Our Expectations

We hope your solution is simple and easy to understand/maintain. With instructions on how to run the code and documentation wherever you deem necessary.

## Beyond our expectations

Quality unit and integration tests, application dockerization and API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger).


## Mandatory

You must deliver the source code of your solution to us in a compressed file (zip) containing the code and all possible documentation. Please do not include unnecessary files such as binaries, compiled files, libraries, etc.;
